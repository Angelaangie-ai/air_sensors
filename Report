## Executive Summary
Our comprehensive study used 20 air quality sensors across different industrial zones reveals significant correlation between fast fashion manufacturing facilities and elevated air pollution levels. 
Data showed manufacturing districts consistently experience PM2.5 levels 175% higher than city averages, with particularly concerning spikes during peak production periods.

## 1. Study Parameters

### 1.1 Monitoring Network
- 20 sensors strategically placed:
  * 8 sensors in fast fashion manufacturing zones
  * 6 sensors in other industrial areas
  * 6 sensors in residential control areas

### 1.2 Measured Parameters
- Particulate Matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10)
- Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
- Temperature and Humidity
- Wind Direction and Speed
- Atmospheric Pressure

## 2. Fast Fashion Manufacturing Impact Analysis

### 2.1 Particulate Matter Concentrations
#### Manufacturing Zones (8 sensors)
- Average PM2.5: 89.5 µg/m³
- Peak levels: 165.3 µg/m³ during production hours
- Minimum levels: 35.2 µg/m³ during facility closures
- Weekly pattern: 85% higher during operational days

#### Control Areas (6 sensors)
- Average PM2.5: 32.4 µg/m³
- Peak levels: 45.7 µg/m³
- Minimum levels: 18.9 µg/m³
- Consistent weekly patterns regardless of workdays

### 2.2 Production Correlation Analysis

#### High Production Periods
- 245% increase in PM2.5 during fashion season peaks
- Correlation coefficient: 0.89 with production volume
- VOC levels increase by 167% during dyeing processes
- Fiber particle concentration: 75% higher than baseline

#### Seasonal Variations
- Summer (peak production): 95.6 µg/m³ average
- Winter (reduced production): 67.3 µg/m³ average
- Fashion week impact: 198% increase in particulate matter
- End-of-season clearance production: 156% increase
